# Revenue_metrics
 Create a dashboard to analyze monetary inflows for the project.
This tool will allow product managers to track the dynamics of changes in monetary inflows and conduct a high-level analysis of the factors influencing these changes.

The project consists of two parts:

1. SQL Query in PostgreSQL (in git)
2. Dashboard in Tableau Publica: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diana.mariia.shalai/viz/Revenue_Metrics_17345363002250/Revenuemetrics#1

The dashboard includes all the following **metrics**:

- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**: The total revenue for a calendar month, but only from sources that are recurring on a monthly basis.
- **Paid Users**: The number of users who are paying customers.
- **Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU)**: The average revenue per paying user, calculated as ARPPU = Revenue / Paid Users.
- **New Paid Users**: The number of users who became paying customers during a specific period.
- **New MRR**: The MRR generated by users who became paying customers in the respective month.
- **Churned Users**: The number of users who stopped paying during a specific period.
- **Churn Rate**: The ratio of churned users in the target period to paid users in the previous period. For example, Churn Rate(June) = Churned Users(June) / Paid Users(May).
- **Churned Revenue**: The total revenue from the previous period generated by users who stopped paying.
- **Revenue Churn Rate**: The ratio of revenue from the previous month generated by users who did not continue paying to the revenue for a specific calendar month. For example, Revenue Churn Rate(June) = - Churned Revenue(June) / MRR(May).
- **Expansion MRR**: The amount by which MRR increased from one month to another, calculated based on users who started paying more in the current month.
- **Contraction MRR**: The amount by which MRR decreased from one month to another, calculated based on users who started paying less in the current month.
- **Customer Lifetime (LT)**: The average duration from the first payment to churn for users, representing the total time an average user stays with the product.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**: The average total amount a user pays during their entire usage of the product, representing the total revenue generated by an average user.

The dashboard includes filters by **date**, **user language**, and **user age**.
